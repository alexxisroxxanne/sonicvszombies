SONIC VS ZOMBIES!

Play as Sonic the Hedgehog running through the desert. Avoid zombies and collect NyanCats to level up.

Using the spacebar or enter key to jump, avoid zombies and collect nyan cats.

Press "p" to pause, and press the up arrow to continue playing.

Spacebar and enter keys can be held down for extended jump. Every 100 points is a level up. Every death sets you back to the nearest hundred points below. You start with three lives, and you can gain one back, for up to three total, for every level up.

Have fun!
